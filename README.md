# alisinabh.com
alisinabh.com is my blog about computer software development.
it mainly contains posts about

- My recent works.
- My experience using different things (i call them things because they may vary a lot in future)
- Tips on software development than may prevent some people wasting their time finding out things i already found.

## Front-End
Front end of alisinabh.com is similar to Elixir syntax (of course, my favorite language so far). its all simple, designed and developed by myself

## Back-End
Back end of alisinabh.com is going to serve on top of Phoenix Framework (a powerful web framework based on plug)
